My great aunt once told me every language you speak is like a different personality.

There are languages that make you confident, there are ones that make you feel shy.

There are languages that make you sad, and languages that make you happy.

My aunt spoke five languages. I always remembered those words.

And I remember them because then and there I decided to learn every language in the world.

I wanted languages to be an important part of my life.

Languages were an escape. They were a place where I could live my dreams.

I could challenge my perception of the world, and learn more about it.

But, there was one thing that I found hard to understand. Why did so few people want to learn different languages?

Could it have just been that they didn't know how useful learning a new language is?

I've now studied 15 languages and lived in five different countries, and I'm no longer sure if my aunt was completely right.

It's not that your personality changes when you speak a different language.

It's more like you're just putting on a different pair of glasses through which to see the world each time.

Learning a foreign language can only help you in life. Languages open doors that you never knew were there. Through languages you meet people that you would have otherwise just walked by.

They give you the chance to see yourself through someone else's eyes.

And in an age where people from different cultures are communicating less, surely that is something that we really need in the world of today.

# ColorTranscribe
a python script for transcribing audio files using dedicated AI Models
and then changing the color of the transcribed text based on the language spoken

type python .\Transcribe3in1.py (after downloading the whole project) into your CMD after travelling to this project's folder
to see all three transcription methods and how they barely work how they're supposed to :P

each method can be called separately by replacing Transcribe3in1.py with a given counterpart
(TranscribeGoogleCloud.py, TranscribeAssembly.py, TranscribeWhisper.py)

# AI Models used for this project:

AssemblyAI - https://github.com/AssemblyAI/cookbook

Google Cloud Speech-To-Text API - https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text

Whisper by OpenAI - https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3

# other Python AI projects I might have taken inspiration from:

custom language detection in Whisper - https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/language-detection-with-whisper/26003/2

language detection in Google Cloud STT - https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/enable-language-recognition-speech-to-text#speech_transcribe_multilanguage_beta-python

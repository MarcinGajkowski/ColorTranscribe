# ColorTranscribe
a python script for transcribing audio files using dedicated AI Models
and then changing the color of the transcribed text based on the language spoken.

AI Models used for this project:

AssemblyAI - https://github.com/AssemblyAI/cookbook

DeepSpeech - https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech

speechbrain - https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain

Whisper? - https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3

other Python AI projects I might have taken inspiration from:
